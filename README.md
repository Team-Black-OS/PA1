###John:
insert function, print function, and clear function completed. That should get us started. We can figure out other stuff to build as well on tuesday. Maybe a search function and a delete node function. 

###Tish:
reading in from a file has been added as well as an example text called string. The readin function calls the insert and places the words from the file into the tree. Might want to think about adding dynamic allocation for the char stars. Right now, it's statically allocated 100 bytes. Typedef'ing the struct(s) would look more concise.
